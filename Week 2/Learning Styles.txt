Learning Styles:

I think the question of whether learning styles really matter isn't a good question. Everyone has some sort of preference when it comes to how information is given to them and how they are encouraged or forced to take in that
information and "learn" (tests, lectures, etc.) However, as a learner, we can only control what we can control. I am not the professor teaching this class, I can't change the class structure. If I'm not satisfied with the 
structure, I could give him feedback, but ultimately I am unable to make the change. However, I can control how I interact with the information given. If the professor lectures each and every class and I find that to be 
unhelpful, nothing is stopping me from developing flash cards, questions, or getting a group of my fellow classmates together to engage in the material in a way that is more helpful for us. Our personal preferences on learning 
does matter and we should consider this when we study and engage with content. But, we should not get hung up on what we cannot control.
